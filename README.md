### 👋 Hi, I’m @ishu9bansal!  

I’m a **software engineer** passionate about **data structures, algorithms, and building interactive learning tools**. My projects often explore concepts from **reactive and functional programming**, making complex ideas more intuitive through visualization and experimentation.  

🚀 **Looking to collaborate?** Check out my repositories and open issues—you can start contributing right away! I’m particularly looking for help in **documenting and enhancing my DSA repository**, so if you love algorithms, let’s work together.  

💡 Most of my projects focus on **learning through exploration**—what I call a **learning inception**. The process of creating these tools helps both the creator and the user gain deeper insights.
